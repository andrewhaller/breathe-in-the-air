## Nice to meet you!

- I live in Naperville, Illinois (Chicago suburb)

- I gardening, cooking, and making things with what I grow. I mostly grow heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, onions, lot's of herbs, and a variety of peppers and hot peppers.

- One of my favorite ways to decompress is going for a 5 mile run in the warm sun, listening to music.

- I prefer driving a manual car and currently drive a Mustang.

- I enjoy spending time with my wife, and our family.

- I'm pretty introverted, so I also enjoy staring at a wall and imagining what life would be like on a planet with no other people.

- I have a large dog -- a Belgian Malinois -- who I've had for 10.5 years, and cat who I've had for about 9 years. I also have a small Yorkie mix who's about 9.5 years old.

- I used to live in Orlando, Florida. In my mid 20s, I played harmonica, the jaw harp (jew’s harp), and some fiddle, in a Bluegrassy-Folk band for 5 years. The band was called “The Token Gamblers”.

## A few of my favorite things ...

- My favorite book, which I've read several times in different translations, is Plato’s “Republic”.

- My favorite movie is “2001: A Space Odyssey” (Kubrick).

- My favorite tv show is Seinfeld.
 
- My favorite rock album is David Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust" ("The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars”). Dark side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) is probably a close tie.

- My favorite music to listen to when I work is older progressive trance and house (DJ Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold, Paul van Dyk, Sander Kleinenberg, ...).
